# Standards catalogue (from D6.2 Chapter 3)

This section is a maintained catalogue of standards, formats, and protocols referenced by the ECHOES / CH Cloud interoperability framework.

!!! note "Normative boundary"
The official deliverable (PDF) contains the authoritative interoperability requirements.  
This catalogue provides reference material and implementation-oriented guidance, and should not introduce new MUST/SHALL obligations.

## How to use this catalogue
Use the pages in this section to:
- identify relevant **data standards and formats** for onboarding and exchange,
- select **protocols and APIs** that maximise interoperability across providers,
- align deployments with widely adopted **infrastructure conventions**,
- implement baseline **security and privacy** expectations consistently,
- express **rights and licensing** as machine-readable metadata.

## Mapping to D6.2
This catalogue is derived from **D6.2 Chapter 3**:
- **3.1** Data standards and formats
- **3.2** Protocols and APIs
- **3.3** Deployment and infrastructure
- **3.4** Security and data privacy
- **3.5** Access and use/reuse in terms of legal interoperability
